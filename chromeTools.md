# Chrome Tools for mobile web development

Chrome has several tools built in that help with developing apps for mobile devices. It is not the only browser that can do this, but it is simple to use

## Part 1 - Creating QR codes for URLS

One of the basic methods we use for opening urls on mobile is via QR code. There are endless websites that can perform this task, but it is convenient that it is built into Chrome
